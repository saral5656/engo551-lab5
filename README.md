Project 5 README

Project 5 is to allow users to interact with an MQTT broker by connecting to a server, visualize location data on a map from the user's personal device, and publish messages to selected topics.

This project consists of three main files:

- main.html: Main webpage with buttons and elements for MQTT connection and map info, and interacting with the MQTT broker.
- design.css: CSS file containing styling rules for buttons and popup for publishing a message
- mapandmqtt.js: JavaScript file contains the logic for MQTT connection management, map handling, and message publishing. It defines functions for starting and ending the MQTT connection, sending location data to the MQTT broker, subscribing to topics, and publishing messages. Additionally, it includes event listeners for button clicks and map interactions.
